# EVK Swapper periphery

The `Swapper` and `SwapVerifier` contracts are helpers for executing swaps and swaps-to-repay operations on EVK vaults, using EVC batches.

## Security and trust boundries

The `Swapper` contract is not trusted. From the protocol's perspective, it is a black box. Provided with a token to sell, it is supposed to execute the swap and return the bought token either as a balance available for deposit or as repaid debt. No assumptions are made about how the swap is performed or about the security of the `Swapper` code. In fact, the `Swapper` has no access control and allows anyone to remove any token balance it holds at any time. The provided implementation is just a reference; users are generally free to use any swapper they choose.

The `SwapVerifier` contract is part of the trusted codebase. Its responsibility is to verify the results of the `Swapper` execution, i.e., that the sold and bought token balances meet the required limits. The checks are simple but are the cornerstone of the security of using the swap periphery. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that all executions of the `Swapper` contract are always followed by proper verification with `SwapVerifier`, presumably as the following item in an EVC batch.

## `Swapper` contract

### General swapping algorithm

The general steps to use the `Swapper` contract are following:

- provision the `Swapper` with tokens to sell.

  The amount provided will serve as an implicit limit for the trade. In most cases the token will be provided with a `withdraw` from an `EVault` (or `borrow` in case of short trades), but the only requirement is that during the swap, the `Swapper` holds enough of the input token to carry out the trade.

- execute a call (or a series of calls) to `swap()` function.

  The assumption is that the calls will consume the provided tokens and buy the required output token.

- call `SwapVerifier` to make sure the results are within accepted bounds.

  The verifiaction should be taking into account any expected slippage and price impact. This step is an essential security measure.

  For regular swaps, `SwapVerifier` assumes that any token balance present in the output vault after the swap is the result of the swap. For this reason the bought token is not deposited for the user automatically by the `Swapper`. It is the verifier that checks slippage and then skims the available assets for the user.

  In case of swap-to-repay mode, the `Swapper` contract is expected to repay the debt for the account, so `SwapVerifier` only checks that the resulting debt matches expectations 

### Interface

The `Swapper` contract should implement the `ISwapper` interface. This ensures, that users could potentially provide their own implementations of the swapper contract in the UI, without needing to modify the FE code.

The main function is `swap()`, which takes a swap definition in a `SwapParams` struct. The params define a handler to use, swapping mode, bought and sold tokens, the amounts etc. See [ISwapper natspec](../src/Swaps/ISwapper.sol) for details. Note, that some parameters might be ignored in certain modes or by certain handlers, while others (`amountOut`) might have differrent semantics in certain modes.

The interface also defines helper functions like `sweep`, `deposit`, `repay` and `repayAndDeposit` which allow consuming the contract's balance.

Finally a `multicall` function allows chaining all of the above to execute complex scenarios.

### Swapping modes

The swaps can be performed in one of 3 modes:
- exact input 

  In this mode, all of the provided input token is expected to be swapped for an unknown amount of the output token. The proceeds are expected to be sent to a vault, to be skimmed by the user, or back to the swapper contract. The latter option is useful when performing complex, multi-stage swaps, where the output token is accumulated in the swapper before being consumed at the end of the operation. Note that the available handlers (1Inch and Uniswap Auto Router) execute a payload encoded off-chain, so a lot of the parameters passed to the `swap` funtion will be ignored and only the amount of input token encoded in the payload will be swapped, even if the swapper holds more.

- exact output

  In this mode, the swapper is expected to purchase a specified amount of the output token in exchange for an unknown amount of the input token. The input token amount provided to the swapper acts as an implicit slippage limit. Currently available handlers (Uniswap V2 and V3) will check the current balance of the output token held by the swapper and adjust the amount of token to buy to only purchase the remainder. This feature can be used to construct multi-stage swaps. For instance, in the first stage, most of the token is bought through a dex aggregator, which presumably offers better price, but doesn't provide exact output swaps. The proceeds are directed to the swapper contract. In the second stage another `swap` call is executed, and the remainder is bought directly in Uniswap, where exact output trades are supported.

  In exact output trades, the remaining, unused input token amount is automatically redeposited for the account in a vault specified in `SwapParams.vaultIn`.

- target debt (swap and repay)

  In this mode, the swapper will check how much debt a provided account has (including current interest accrued), compare it with a target debt the user requests, and the amount already held by the swapper contract, and by exact output trade will buy exactly the amount required to repay the debt (down to the target amount). In most cases the target amount will be zero, which means the mode can be used to close debt positions without leaving any dust.

  After buying the necessary amount, the swapper will automatically execute `repay` on the liability vault for the user.

  If at the time the swap is executed, the swapper contract holds more funds than necessary to repay to the target debt, the swap is not carried out, but instead the debt is repaid and any surplus of the output token is deposited for the account in the liability vault. This allows combined swaps to safely target high ratios of exact input swaps vs exact output remainders. The exact input swap doesn't know the exact amount of output that will be received and it can 'over-swap' more than is necessary to repay the debt. Because the surplus doesn't revert the transaction, high ratios of better priced exact input swaps can be targeted by the UI.

  Finally, and similarly to exact output, any unused input will be redeposited for the account.


### Handlers

The swapper contract executes trades using external providers like 1Inch or Uniswap. Internal handler modules take care of interfacing with the provider. They are enumerated by a `bytes32` encoded string. The available handlers are listed as constants in `Swapper.sol`.

- 1Inch handler

  Only supports `exact input` mode. Executes a payload returned by [1Inch API](https://portal.1inch.dev/documentation/swap/introduction) on the aggregator contract.

- Uniswap Auto Router handler

  Supports `exact input` and `exact output` modes. Executes payloads created with [Uniswap's Auto Router](https://github.com/Uniswap/smart-order-router) on [SwapRouter02](https://etherscan.io/address/0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45). Payload is simply executed in both modes, so in exact output, the handler will not try to update the amount bought with balance already present in the swapper, as the other uniswap handlers.

- Uniswap V2 handler

  Doesn't support `exact input`. Executes exact output swaps on [UniswapV2 router](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D)

- Uniswap V3 handler

  Doesn't support `exact input`. Executes exact output swaps on [UniswapV3 router](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564)

## `SwapVerifier` contract

This simple contract only provides 2 functions to verify results of the swaps and swaps-and-repays.

`verifyAmountMinAndSkim` - Checks the amount of assets available to skim on a vault and reverts if it is less than the required minimum. After verification the function skims available assets for the specified account. The assets available are considered the result of the swap. The user must make sure to put all the tokens bought with the swapper in the vault, either by performing swaps directly into the vault, or by calling `sweep` on the swapper, before calling the verification function (see F2. in common flows below).

`verifyDebtMax` - Checks that the debt of an account is not larger than given max amount. Swapper contract will automatically repay the debt when executing swap-and-repay mode, so no additional steps are required before or after verification.

## Common flows in EVK

F1. Swap exact amount of deposits from one EVault (A) to another (B)
- fetch a swap payload from either 1Inch api or Uniswap Auto Router, setting B as the receiver
- create EVC batch call with the following items:
  - `A.withdraw` the required input token amount to the swapper contract 
  - `Swapper.swap` - `exact input` on the selected handler
  - `SwapVerifier.verifyAmountMinAndSkim` Check a minimum required amount was bought for the input, according to slippage settings and claim it for the user.

F2. Swap deposits from one EVault (A) to exact amount of another (B)
- find an exact input payload on 1Inch or Uniswap Auto Router such that most of the required output amount is bought. E.g., binary search input amount that yields 98% of the required output amount. The receiver encoded in the payload must be the swapper contract.
- create EVC batch with the following items:
  - `A.withdraw` to the swapper contract. The amount must cover all of the estimated swap costs with some extra, to account for slippage
  - `swapper.multicall` with the following items:
    - `Swapper.swap` - `exact input` with the off-chain payload
    - `Swapper.swap` - `exact output` on one of the supportin handlers (Uni V2/V3) with the user specified `amountOut`. The receiver can be either the swapper contract or B vault.
    - `Swapper.sweep` the output token, into the B vault
  - `SwapVerifier.verifyAmountMinAndSkim` check a minimum required amount was bought and claim the funds for the user. Because exact output swaps are not guaranteed to be exact always, a small slippage could be allowed.

F3. Create leveraged position

The process is the same as in F1 or F2, but instead of withdrawing, the input token (short asset) is borrowed, with the `receiver` set to the swapper contract. To create leverage, the output token (long asset) should be deposited into a vault that is configured as collateral for the vault where the loan is taken. Of course, the user needs to enable correct controller and collaterals on the EVC first.

F4. Sell deposits from one vault (A) to repay debt in another (B)
- prepare a payload exactly like in F2, setting the bought amount to the debt user intends to repay
- create EVC batch with the following items:
- `A.withdraw` to the swapper contract. The amount must cover all of the estimated swap costs with extra to account for slippage
- `swapper.multicall` with the following items:
  - `Swapper.swap` - `exact input` with the off-chain payload
  - `Swapper.swap` - `target debt` mode on one of the supporting handlers (Uni V2/V3). The `amountOut` should be set to the amount of debt the user requested to have after the operation. Set to zero, to repay full debt.
- `SwapVerifier.verifyDebtMax` check that the user's debt matches the expectations. Because exact output swaps are not guaranteed to be exact always, a small slippage could be allowed.

F5. Sell deposit from one vault (A) to repay debt in another (B) when exact output is unavailable

For some token pairs, the exact output swap might not be available at all, or the price impact might be too big due to poor liquidity in Uniswap. In such cases to repay the full debt:
- find an exact input payload on 1Inch or Uniswap Auto Router, to buy slightly **more** of the output token than is necessary to repay the debt, taking into account slippage on exchanges and interest accrual between the payload generation and transaction execution. E.g., binary search input amount that yields 102% of the current debt. Set the receiver to the liability vault.
- create EVC batch with the following items:
  - `A.withdraw` the required input token amount to the swapper contract
  - `Swapper.swap` - `exact input` on the selected handler
  - `SwapVerifier.verifyAmountMinAndSkim` check that the minimum required amount was bought and claim it for the user
  - `B.repayWithShares` setting the amount to max uint256. Debt should be removed to zero, with the remainder of the output token deposited in B vault for the borrower.
